Avisynth is a scripting language and a collection of filters for simple (and not so simple!) non-linear video editing tasks. It frameserves video to applications.

This is SEt's 2.5.8 MT version compiled with MSVC 2010 (SP1) so it will run on Windows XP SP3 and newer.

All credits goes to the AviSynth developers and SEt.
