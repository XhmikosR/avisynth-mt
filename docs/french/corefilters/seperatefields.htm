</p><p>NTSC and PAL video signals are sequences of fields, but all capture cards that
I'm aware of capture two fields at a time and interlace (or "weave") them into
frames. So frame 0 in the capture file contains fields 0 and 1; frame 1 contains
fields 2 and 3; and so on. <tt>SeparateFields</tt> takes a frame-based clip
and splits each frame into its component fields, producing a new clip with twice
the frame rate and twice the frame count. This is useful if you would like to
use <tt>Trim</tt> and similar filters with single-field accuracy.
</p><p><tt>SeparateFields</tt> uses the field-dominance information in the source
clip to decide which of each pair of fields to place first in the output. If
it gets it wrong, use <tt>ComplementParity</tt> before <tt>SeparateFields</tt>.
If it gets it <em>really</em> wrong, you may want to use <tt>AssumeFrameBased</tt>
also.
</p><p>This filter has no effect if the clip is already field-based.
