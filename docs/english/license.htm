(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

Linking Avisynth statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on Avisynth.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of Avisynth give you
permission to link Avisynth with independent modules that communicate
with Avisynth solely through the interfaces defined in avisynth.h,
regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to
copy and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your
choice, provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by
a complete copy of the source code of Avisynth (the version of Avisynth
used to produce the combined work), being distributed under the terms of
the GNU General Public License plus this exception.  An independent
module is a module which is not derived from or based on Avisynth, such
as 3rd-party filters, import and export plugins, or graphical user
interfaces.

<h3>AviSynth documentation license</h3>

<p>AviSynth documentation is Copyright &copy; 2002-2007 AviSynth
  developers and contributors.</p> 

<p>Starting from 5 August 2007 the following documentation is released
  under the
  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CreativeCommons
  Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License</a>
  (abbreviated by "CC BY-SA 3.0", see also
  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode">full license terms</a>): 
<ul>
<li>All content of the AviSynth Wiki at avisynth.org, except the
  AviSynth Filter SDK.</li>

<li>The off-line documentation which is distributed with AviSynth
  itself, except any external plugin documentation which is copyright
  corresponding authors (see description of these plugins for their
  license terms).</li>
</ul>

<p>When editing this Wiki or using material from this Wiki or off-line
  documentation you are bound by the terms of this license, and these
  terms are briefly as follows:</p> 

<p>You are allowed to copy, modify or improve the content of the
  AviSynth Wiki and the off-line documentation provided that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share Alike (SA): The resulting changes are licensed under the
  same or a compatible license as the AviSynth Wiki and the off-line
  documentation (which is "CC BY-SA 3.0").</li>

<li>Attribution (BY): Permit users to copy, distribute, display and
  perform the work and make derivative works based upon it only if they
  give the author or licensor the credits in the manner specified by
  these. This implies that if you distribute parts of the documentation
  (such as articles or scripts) your should refer to "AviSynth
  documentation Wiki" (or "AviSynth documentation") with link to these
  pages or to the main site: avisynth.org.  You must also keep
  attributions for the parts attributed to other resources or authors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides above two requirements, you also agree that:</p>
<ul>
<li>attribution of your contributions will (or may) be given to AviSynth
  project in a form "AviSynth documentation" or "AviSynth documentation
  Wiki" (avisynth.org).</li>

<li>your contribution (and main Wiki content) may be relicensed by the
  AviSynth developers team under a compatible license.</li> 
<li>you are also promising us that you wrote the contributions yourself,
  or copied it from public domain, or from work with a compatible license.
  DO NOT SUBMIT COPYRIGHTED WORK WITHOUT PERMISSION!</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this license has a fair-use clause (article 2):</p>

<p><i>"2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
  reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
  arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
  connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other
  applicable laws."</i></p>

<p>which, in our opinion, explicitly permits you to post and discuss
  scripts (from the documentation) where ever you want without the need to
  mention its license or its authors, but it is civil to credit the
  developers and script authors.  Of course, you may not declare yourself
  as its author or distribute the documentation under an uncompatible
  license.</p>

<p>AviSynth documentation translations to other languages (both at the
  wiki and off-line) should be under same or compatible license terms.</p>

<h3>AviSynth logo</h3>

<p>'Film and Gears' logo was contributed to AviSynth project by doom9
  forum member 'Shayne'.</p>

<p>'Tray and AviSynth' logo (now at old wiki pages) was contributed to
  AviSynth project by anonymous sh0dan's friend.</p>

<p>Permission to use and/or modify these logos is granted provided that
  your materials are related to AviSynth and you give an attribution to
  avisynth.org.</p>
