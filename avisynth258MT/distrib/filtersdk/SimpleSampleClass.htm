//=============== SECTION #1: Includes and Prototypes  =================

//following two includes are needed
#include "windows.h"
#include "avisynth.h"



//------------ Prototype the functions, ect. So we can call/use them later. 

//--------------------------------------------------------------
// Prototype AvisynthPluginInit2()
//
// Avisynth calls this when you do LoadPlugin("c:\myplugin.dll").
// All the fancy stuff on the front is for the external call to your dll.
// Basically you use this to add your function to Avisynth.
// 
// Parms:
//		env - This is a pointer back to Avisynth so you can setup your filter.
//				It's type is a class defined in avisynth.h.  Basically it lets
//				you call functions to set things up.
//
// Returns - Looks like it returns a string.  Did you know?
//
//---------------------------------------------------------------

extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) const char* __stdcall AvisynthPluginInit2(IScriptEnvironment* env);




//---------------------------------------------
// Prototype Create_SimpleSample()
//
// Avisynth calls this when a script runs your function.  
//
// Parms:
//		args - contains all the arguments passed to the function by the script
//	
//		user_data - can be used to pass in a chunk of filter info.  This data pointer
//					comes from you when you setup your function in AvisynthPluginInit2()
//
//		env - Pointer back to Avisynth so you can call it's functions.
//
// Return - AVSValue can take on many types.  It's not quite a void pointer.  It's a class
//			defined in the avisynth.h file, but it lets you return anything a script might need.
//			After all, this is where you get called and return to a script.
//
//---------------------------------------------------------------

//---------------------------------------------
// Prototype SimpleSample Class
//
// This is your class.  If you don't know classes, think of it as
// a structure with function pointers.  There are only two functions
// here; SimpleSample() (the constructor) and GetFrame().  This is the
// Prototype so we can use it later.  The details of the functions are not
// here.  Just enough info to create the class structure.
// 
// SimpleSample is based on the GenericVideoFilter class which is defined in 
// the avisynth.h file.  GenericVideoFilter is based on another class.  This just
// means your class 'structure' already comes with a few function pointers.
// you can then replace the ones you want with your own functionality.  If you
// don't care about the other ones, you get the built in functionality ... which
// probably does things like return zero.
//
// At the risk of repeating ... we really only care about rwo functions.
// SimpleSample() and GetFrame()
//
