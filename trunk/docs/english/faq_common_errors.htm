<h3>
I got the message "LoadPlugin: unable to load &quot;xxx (some plugin)&quot; is not an AviSynth 1.0/AviSynth 2.0 plugin"?
</h3>
<p>
You are using a plugin which is not compatiable with that version of AviSynth.
As explained <a href="faq_general_info.htm#How_do_I_use_a_plugin_compiled_for_v2.0x_in_v2.5x.3F">here</a>,
plugins compiled for AviSynth v2.5 are not compatible with AviSynth v1.0x/v2.0x
and vice versa.
</p>
<a name="error_no_function"></a>
<h3>
When frameserving I got the following message: "Script error, there is no function named "xxx (some filter)"" ?
</h3>
<p>
You probably installed/registered a version of AviSynth which doesn't contain
that specific filter. Make sure that there are no other versions floating around
on your hard disk (there's a possibility that a version will be registered while
it is not in your system directory). Make sure that the latest stable
version is registered,
see also <a href="faq_general_info.htm#How_do_I_know_which_version_number_of_AviSynth_I_have.3F">here</a>.
</p>
<a name="no_decoder"></a>
<h3>
I installed AviSynth and got the following error message: "Couldn't locate decompressor for format 'YV12' (unknown)."?
</h3>
<p>
Install a codec which supports YV12. DivX5 or one of the recent <a href="http://www.xvid.org/">XviD
builds of Koepi</a> or <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=56972">Helix
YUV codec</a> or some other (ffvfw, ffdshow). If that still doesn't work, modify
your registry as explained in the next question.
</p>
<a name="no_acm_codec"></a>
<h3>
When encoding I got the following error "ACM failed to suggest a compatible PCM format"?
</h3>
<p>This error means that you are using AviSource to open your AVI file, but you
don't have an ACM codec to decode the audio stream. The most common problem is
that your audio is an AC3 or a MP3 stream, but you don't have the corresponding
ACM codec installed. It can also happen that your audio is a
&quot;crippled&quot; (that is, with an incorrect header) MP3 <a href="http://forums.virtualdub.org/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=4&amp;t=802&amp;hl=0055">[1]</a>
<a href="http://forums.virtualdub.org/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=3&amp;t=10931&amp;hl=unknown%20tag%200055&amp;st=15">[2]</a>
<a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=94760">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>There are several solutions for this problem:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get the proper ACM codec. You can use <a href="http://www.headbands.com/gspot/">GSpot</a>
    to find out which audio stream you are dealing with. The needed ACM codecs
    can be found <a href="advancedtopics/importing_media.htm">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Demux your audio with an application like <a href="http://www.alexander-noe.com/video/amg/">AVI-Mux
    GUI</a> or <a href="http://www.virtualdub.org">VirtualDub</a>,
    and import your audio with a specific plugin. See also <a href="faq_loading_clips.htm">here.</a></li>
  <li>Use <a href="corefilters/directshowsource.htm" title="DirectShowSource">DirectShowSource</a>
    to open the audio. Install <a href="http://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/">ffdshow</a>
    and enable the specific audio format in the &quot;Audio Decoder
    Properties&quot; tab. Create the following script:</li>
</ul>
<pre>Vid = AviSource(&quot;Blah.avi&quot;, audio=false)
Aud = DirectShowSource(&quot;Blah.avi&quot;, video=false)
AudioDub(Vid, Aud)</pre>
<a name="error_framesize"></a>
<h3>
When encoding I got the following error: &quot;framesize xyz x 56 not supported"?
</h3>
<p>
This usually is an indicator of a script error, where the input is actually the
error message being displayed. Here, xyz is the length of the error message text
and 56 is the height (xyz will vary depending on the error message whilst the
height will always be 56 pixels). Your encoder is seeing the error message as an
RGB32 input source and hence the error. Opening the script with WMP or
VirtualDub should display the error message. Fix the error in the script and
retry to encode.
</p>
<a name="no_decoder2"></a>
<h3>
When frameserving I got the following message: &quot;AVISource: couldn't locate a decompressor for fourcc
(...)&quot;?
</h3>
<p>Usually, this error message shows up if you don't have the right VfW codec
installed for decoding your video. Get <a href="http://www.headbands.com/gspot/">Gspot</a>
to find out which codec you need. Get, for example, <a href="http://www.xvid.org/">XviD</a>
for your MPEG-4 ASP clips and <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=94458">Cedocida
codec</a> for your DV clips. If you have problems finding the right one, ask
around on the video forums.</p>
<p>But it can also show up if you call <a href="corefilters/avisource.htm" title="AviSource">AviSource</a>
too many times. The dll for the decompression codec is loaded separately for
every AviSource call. Eventually an OS-imposed limit is reached, the codec can't
be loaded and you get that error message. More discussion can be found <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=131687">here</a>.
A good solution is to use a number of scripts (keeping each below the
problematic limit of avi calls) and encode them separately, and join them
afterwards in some application.</p>
<a name="error_dss"></a>
<h3>
When frameserving I got the following message: &quot;DirectShowSource: Could not open as video or audio<br>
Video Returned: "DirectShowSource: the filter graph manager won't talk to me"&quot;?</h3>
<p>This is a common error that occurs when DirectShow isn't able to deliver any
format that is readable to AviSynth. Try creating a filter graph manually. See
if you are able to construct a filter graph that delivers any output that
AviSynth can open. If not, you might need to download additional DirectShow
filters that can deliver correct material. If you can play the graph in <a href="http://avisynth.org/mediawiki/GraphEdit" title="GraphEdit">GraphEdit</a>,
make sure to remove the video and audio renderers, before saving the graph and
opening it in AviSynth. Some examples can be found <a href="advancedtopics/importing_media.htm#graphs" title="Importing media">here</a>.</p>

<h3>
I am trying to load a script that has a path name with a mix of japanese characters (someone's name) and Ascii test. I
got an import error and the path that is displayed has some strange characters (not the japanese
characters)?
</h3>
<p>AviSynth has problems with non-ANSI chars on filenames. It only supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">8
bit character ANSI text</a>. Some discussion about this: <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=110467">[4]</a>
and <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=131419">[5]</a>.
</p>
<a name="CAVIStreamSynth"></a>
<h3>
When frameserving I got the following message: &quot;CAVIStreamSynth: System exception - Access Violation at 0x0, reading from 0x0&quot;?
</h3>
<p>Access Violation at 0x0, reading from 0x0
is usually caused by running out of memory (memory leak ???). It can be caused
by a plugin which is leaking memory, but apparently it can also be caused by
other things (codecs, applications ???) [<a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=123195">1</a>]
[<a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=128403">2</a>]. Add
SetMemoryMax(...) at the beginning of the script. If that doesn't help, report
the issue in the doom9 forums, and we will try to help finding the cause of it.</p>
<a name="InvalidArguments"></a>
<h3>When frameserving I got a message similar to: &quot;Avisynth open failure: Script error: Invalid arguments to function &quot;xxx (some filter)&quot;
(I:\Video.avs, line 5)&quot;</h3>
<p>It means you are passing incorrect arguments (that is of the correct type) to
your script, filter or plugin. For example:</p>
<pre># passing a float (2.0), while <a href="corefilters/loop.htm">Loop</a> expects an int:
Loop(clip, 2.0)</pre>
<pre># passing three clips to <a href="corefilters/overlay.htm">Overlay</a> instead of two:
AviSource(&quot;anime_raw.avi&quot;)
karaoke = AviSource(&quot;karaoke.avi&quot;)
Trim(0,999) + Trim(1000,1030).Overlay(last, karaoke, mask=sign.ShowAlpha()) + Trim(1031,0)
# last should be omitted as argument to Overlay</pre>
<pre># implicit 'last' not defined
v = AviSource(&quot;myvid.avi&quot;)
Trim(100, 199)
# need to use v.Trim(...) here</pre>
<p>So make sure the passed arguments are of the correct type and read the
corresponding documentation if necessary.</p>
