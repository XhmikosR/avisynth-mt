	V1.0 - 1st release.
	V1.0a - Revised version to put colourspace checking in the right place.
  V1.0b - Added detailed comments.  // sh0dan
	V1.1 - Added sh0dan's planar (YV12) code
	V1.2 - Revert to RGB24 colourspace only to show simple pixel manipulation;
	V1.3 - add in a parameter to vary the size of the square.
	V1.4 - Add in RGB32 colourspace code
